I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Sprinklr](sprinklr.com), developing distributed systems for computer vision, natural language and speech processing. I graduated with a Bachelors from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2019.

I worked on problems spanning Manufacturing, Control Systems, Computational Physics and Machine Learning during my undergraduate years.
